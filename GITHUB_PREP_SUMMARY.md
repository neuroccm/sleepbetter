## What Was Sanitized

### Removed/Changed:
- ❌ Personal sleep data (December 2025 specific dates)
- ❌ Medical information (syncope event, lab values)
- ❌ Age 48 → Changed to 35
- ❌ Specific medical notes → "Sample user data"
- ❌ "48-Year-Old Male" in graph titles → "Sleep Analysis & Tracking"

### Kept:
- ✅ All functionality intact
- ✅ Sleep science information (generic and educational)
- ✅ Code quality and comments
- ✅ Color schemes and visualizations

## Data Generated

The `init` command now generates:
- **30 days** of sample data (dynamic - starts 30 days before current date)
- **Realistic variation**:
  - 75% normal nights (6.5-8 hours)
  - 15% poor nights (<6 hours)
  - 10% excellent nights (8+ hours)
- **Randomized but reproducible** (seed=42)
- Shows the tool's features without exposing personal data

## Testing Results

✅ **Tested and verified:**
```bash
python3 sleepbetter.py init
# Output: Initialized with 30 days of sample data
# Total sleep debt: 1:13 hours

python3 sleepbetter.py status
# Shows proper formatted output with sample data
```

## Next Steps for GitHub Publication

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
cd forGH
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: SleepBetter CLI v1.0.0

- Personal sleep tracking tool
- Progressive debt calculation
- Visual analytics with matplotlib
- Science-based recommendations
- Interactive dashboard mode

Author: Houman Khosravani MD PhD FRCPC
License: MIT"
```

### 2. Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `sleepbetter` or `sleepbetter-cli`
3. Description: "A command-line sleep tracking tool with debt calculation and science-based recovery recommendations"
4. Public repository
5. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sleepbetter.git
git branch -M main

- `personal-health`

### 5. Optional: GitHub Release

Create a release for v1.0.0:
1. Go to Releases → Create new release
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: "SleepBetter CLI v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
4. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
